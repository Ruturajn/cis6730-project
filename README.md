This project aims to explore the event stream monitoring program named DejaVu. It is a first-order past time LTL based verification tool. Every directory in
this repository has atleast one `prop.qtl` file and a `log` file. The logs contains the event streams and the `prop` contains the specification
that the log files must satisfy. 

Each directory also contains a screenshot showing the verification in action, along with the command that can be used for running these examples. Most of these examples 
have been taken from the [`DejaVu`](https://github.com/havelund/dejavu) repository, with modifications that make these examples work. The others are implemented by us 
based on our understanding of the tool.
